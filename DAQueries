# SQL Queries

Below are some SQL queries used in this project for analyzing Anxiety or Depression based on reported frequency of symptoms during the Last 7 Days. 

*Note: We used CAST due to certain columns in the dataset have a data type of strings (text) instead of numbers (numeric data types). This is not best practice, should have transform the data before loading. This was my first time building a ETL pipelines and querying the data extracted.

**Query 1: Average anxiety and depress level for each race**
**Description:** This query provides insights level for each race.

```sql
SELECT indicator, subgroup AS race_ethnicity, CONCAT(CAST(AVG(value) AS DECIMAL(10,2)), '%') AS average_anxiety_depression_level_percentage 
FROM depress 
WHERE indicator IN ('Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder', 'Symptoms of Depressive Disorder') 
AND "group" = 'By Race/Hispanic ethnicity' 
GROUP BY indicator, subgroup 
ORDER BY race_ethnicity;
```

**Query 2: Average level of symptoms of depression over the years.** 
**Description:** This query shows the changes in depression symptoms over the years.

```sql
SELECT TO_CHAR(time_period_start_date, 'YYYY') AS year, CAST(AVG(value) AS numeric(10, 2)) AS average_depression_level 
FROM depress 
WHERE indicator = 'Symptoms of Depressive Disorder' 
GROUP BY year ORDER BY year;
```

**Query 3: Top 5 states with the highest anxiety levels**
**Description:** This query selects the top 5 states with the highest anxiety levels

```sql
SELECT state, CAST(AVG(value) AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS average_anxiety_level 
FROM depress WHERE indicator = 'Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder' 
AND "group" = 'By State' 
GROUP BY state 
ORDER BY average_anxiety_level DESC LIMIT 5;
```

**Query 4: Anxiety and depression levels different across age groups**
**Description:** This query pulls the aniexty and depression levels from different age groups

```sql
SELECT d1.subgroup AS age_group, CAST(AVG(d1.value) AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS average_anxiety_level, CAST(AVG(d2.value) AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS average_depression_level 
FROM depress d1 JOIN depress d2 ON d1.subgroup = d2.subgroup 
WHERE d1.indicator = 'Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder' 
AND d2.indicator = 'Symptoms of Depressive Disorder' 
AND d1."group" = 'By Age' 
AND d2."group" = 'By Age' 
GROUP BY d1.subgroup;
```
